            Audio Features: The speaker sounds sad, so it can be inferred that they are experiencing some form of depression. The prosody and acoustics of their speech suggest a downward emotional state. However, more information about the context and content of the speech would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis of depression. It could also be possible that the speaker is just expressing their feelings honestly without any underlying psychological condition. Therefore, we cannot determine with certainty whether the person is depressed or not based on the given information.
