            Audio Features: The speaker seems to be experiencing sadness based on her speech content and emotional tone. However, it is hard to determine whether she is clinically depressed or not as there are other factors such as age, gender, cultural background, etc., which can influence the perception of sadness. Therefore, more information about the speaker's personal life and medical history is needed to make an accurate diagnosis. As for the prosodic, acoustic, linguistic, and physiological markers, they seem to support the speaker's sadness. The pitch, volume, and rhythm of her voice indicate a low energy level, slow speech rate, and monotone delivery, which are typical features of sadness.

This suggests that she is likely not depressed, as depression often leads to negative emotions and attitudes towards life.

It's okay to be afraid, but I don't want you to give up. Because the thing about depression is it lies.
            Audio Features: The speaker seems to be expressing their emotions through speech, which suggests that they may be experiencing some form of depression. The prosody of their voice indicates that they are feeling sadness and hopelessness. However, there is no clear indication of whether they are currently depressed or not based on the given information.

It doesn't get to take you. Because you're stronger than that, and you're worth more than that, and it's possible.
            Audio Features: The speaker seems to be feeling sadness and hopelessness based on the acoustic features of the speech. The prosody suggests a monotone voice with low pitch which is often associated with depression. However, there are no clear markers of physical symptoms of depression like tremors or tics, so it is difficult to determine if the speaker is actually experiencing depression or not. Therefore, we can only infer that the speaker may be feeling down or melancholic based on the acoustic features of their speech. This information could be useful for mental health professionals who want to assess the emotional state of the speaker.

Things started to feel more heavy. I started to self-harm as a way to cope.
            Audio Features: The emotion conveyed by the audio clip is sadness. The prosodic features such as pitch, volume, and duration suggest that the speaker is experiencing negative emotions like sadness, grief, or disappointment. However, the absence of other acoustic features like crying, sobbing, or whining suggests that the speaker may be trying to maintain control over their emotions. Therefore, we can infer that the person is likely feeling depressed but is trying to hide it.

And I told my social worker that I didn't necessarily want to die.
            Audio Features: The prosody, acoustics, linguistics, and physiology markers suggest that the speaker may be experiencing depression. The low pitch and slow speech rate indicate sadness and lack of energy.

I just knew that was something that happened to me. Around middle school, I started to get depressed, and it progressively got worse as I got into high school.
            Audio Features: The emotion conveyed by the audio clip is sadness, which could be related to depression. The prosodic features such as pitch, volume, and rhythm suggest a somber mood. However, the acoustic features like breathing patterns and heartbeat sounds do not indicate any specific mental disorder. Therefore, we can conclude that the person may be experiencing some level of sadness but not necessarily depression.

That's when I'm like what they call manic, which is high. Now when I'm down, I could be depressed, not want to eat or sleep properly or get motivated just to do daily tasks.
