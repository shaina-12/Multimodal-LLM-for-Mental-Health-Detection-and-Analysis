Also, it sort of coincides with this feeling of not being excited about anything, which again, on a day when you feel great or even normal, you can get excited about things. Like you're like, oh, I'm gonna have pizza today, or I'm gonna see a friend today, or any, all of the fun things about life.

So there's this real disconnect because I know logically that should be a feeling that induces some happiness, but it's like my depression will not let me recognize those feelings. At 40, I don't believe anything should be taboo anymore. I talked to my kids about sex, and yes, they're very young, but they wanted to know how they got here, and we talked about it. And they were grossed out and left the room.
            Audio Features: Based on the Prosodic, Acoustic, Linguistic, temporal and Physiological markers in the audio, it can be inferred that the speaker is experiencing depression. The low pitch, slow speed, and monotone tone of the speech indicate sadness and lack of energy. Additionally, the absence of any positive emotions or expressions suggests a negative mood. Therefore, it can be concluded that the person is likely depressed based on these markers. However, further analysis may be needed to confirm.

            Audio Features: Based on the audio, it sounds like the speaker is experiencing anxiety and feeling overwhelmed by decision making.
