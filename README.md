## 📝 Introduction
Multimodal LLM for Mental Health Detection and Analysis leverages large language models combined with multimodal data (text, audio, images) to help identify signs of mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and depression. This project explores innovative methods for better understanding mental health indicators using a deep learning approach.

## 🎯 Motivation
Mental health is a critical aspect of well-being, and early detection can save lives. With the help of Multimodal LLMs, we aim to develop accurate and proactive tools to assist healthcare professionals in identifying early indicators of mental health disorders.

## ✨ Features
- 🚀 **Multimodal Input**: Accepts text, audio, and image data for comprehensive analysis.
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes transformer-based models to classify mental health states.
- 📊 **Extensive Analysis**: Provides detailed analysis of detected symptoms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python** for data processing and modeling
- 🔥 **PyTorch** for deep learning model implementation
- 🤗 **Hugging Face Transformers** for LLM-based analysis
- 📊 **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation
- 🎵 **Librosa** for audio feature extraction
- 📷 **OpenCV** for image processing

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/multimodal-llm-mental-health.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Prepare the input data:
   - 📝 Text: A .txt or .csv file with user responses.
   - 🎤 Audio: Recordings in .wav format.
   - 📸 Images: User's facial expressions or relevant photos.

2. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python run_analysis.py --input data_folder/
   ```

3. View the results in the console or export them as a report.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: The dataset is a combination of publicly available mental health datasets like **DAIC-WOZ** for text and audio and **Facial Emotion Recognition** datasets.
- **Access**: Please check the [dataset page](https://linktodataset.com) for access instructions.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
This project uses a combination of **BERT** for text analysis, **CNN** for image processing, and **RNN** with **attention mechanisms** for audio analysis.
